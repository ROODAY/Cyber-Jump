Cyber Jump
===========
***ROODAY***   

Inspired by Mega Jump, and making use of [this](http://www.raywenderlich.com/63229/make-game-like-mega-jump-spritekit-part-12) tutorial, ROODAY jump is a platforming game I created for my 10th grade iOS Programming class.    

Features:   
Procedurally Generated games with randomly placed platforms and star. This means that every time you play, it's a different experience!   
Instead of using the accelerometer to control the player's movement, a simple Dpad constrained to the X axis is used instead, moving the player laterally at different speeds depending on the extent the dpad is moved.   
Points awarded for collecting Stars and Moving farther up the game, and highscores are saved locally.

ROODAY Jump    
===========
***ROODAY***   

Inspired by Doodle Jump, and making use of [this](http://www.raywenderlich.com/63229/make-game-like-mega-jump-spritekit-part-12) tutorial, ROODAY jump is a platforming game I created for my 10th grade iOS Programming class.    

Features:   
Platforms   
Movement Buttons (Since iPhone emulator does not have an accelerometer)   
Points gained by hitting platforms, moving higher, and collecting stars
